### Optimized Design Pattern - By Ame Gilham (100741352) 


### Game Description (same as A2)

A simple platformer where the player can defeat enemies from above or below and jump around on platforms. 
The enemies travel back and forth in a line, the player wins by defeating all of the enemies. 
From the main men there is a level editor the player can use to make levels, if no levels are found in the
files it will generate an empty level by default.
